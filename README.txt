EMTFucker

25 to Life EMT<->OGG converter

IMPORTANT: The input file (in case you're converting to EMT) HAS TO BE an OGG audio file, otherwise it will not work. It's the EMT<->OGG converter, remember?


**** There are two versions here: UI & CMD.
- UI version weighs more and requires VLC Media Player be installed on your system, but you can play-back the audio files.
- CMD version weighs much less and doesn't require anything but it can't play-back the audio-files, only convert.
See details below.


Required prerequisites for CMD version (emtfucker-cmd.exe):
    Windows 7 & above

Usage (CMD):
    Run it through the Windows Command-Line, specify the input file (ogg/emt) as the first parameter & the output file (emt/ogg) as the second parameter. For example, if you want to convert an EMT file to OGG, run it like this: "emtfucker-cmd myfile.emt outputfile.ogg"



Required prerequisites for UI version (emtfucker.exe):
    .NET Framework 2.0
    Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable Package
    VLC Media Player for file play-back
    Windows 7 & above

Usage (UI):
  - Run EMTFucker, click File->Open, select the file-type you wish to open (EMT/OGG), wait until it loads, it might freeze for a second or two.
  - Click File, hover your mouse cursor over Convert to, another menu will pop up, there you can choose the format you want to convert the file to.
  - If you've opened an EMT file, choose OGG, but if it's an OGG file you have opened, choose EMT. Converting from OGG to OGG or from EMT to EMT doesn't make any sense.

    You can play-back any file that you've opened using PLAY & PAUSE buttons as well as control volume with the Volume slider.
